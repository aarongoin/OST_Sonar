# OST_Sonar
A digital version of of the Sonar Deck for Operation: Silent Threat (OST) which is a submarine warfare board game.

The Sonar mechanic is the most time-consuming aspect of the game. Using a digital version cuts that time down dramatically.

# The Game Mechanic
The Sonar Deck is comprised of 50 unique cards that the Submarine player uses to encode and obscure his position on the game board.

The game board consists of 4 colored quadrants, each with 90 positions that the submarine can occupy. Each position is divided into 1-5 different depths.


## Sonar Deck contains 50 cards:

10 x Red Quadrant cards (numbers 0 through 9)

10 x Orange Quadrant cards (numbers 0 through 9)

10 x Purple Quadrant cards (numbers 0 through 9)

10 x Green Quadrant cards (numbers 0 through 9)

5 x Depth cards (numbers 0 through 4)

5 x Speed cards (numbers 0 through 4)


With the Sonar mechanic: each unique position can be encoded with 3 cards from the Sonar Deck.

## Sonar Mechanic works as follows:

The submarine player removes the 4 cards that detail his position (2 cards), depth, and current speed and places them in a pile.

Then the player shuffles the Sonar Deck.

Based on the submarine's Stealth value (which is a product of their speed and depth), they add that many cards to their pile (without looking at them).

Then the player shuffles their small pile.

Their opponent has their own Detection value (which is a product of their speed), and they may draw that many cards from their opponent's pile.

The drawn cards contain some or all of their opponent's true data mixed with some false data as well.
